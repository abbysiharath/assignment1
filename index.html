<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
<p>I transferred from engineering into IT because i enjoyed the programming side of my previous course. Information technology also appealed to me due to its career prospects  and wide range of qualifications. Nevertheless, i’ve always found interest in working with technology and love to learn about it, which is probably a strength of mine. Since young i’ve been asked to solve issues in technology whether present in the classroom or home environment. I have some people in my life that have studied/are studying IT, and this encouraged me further to take up the program. Unfortunately i do not have any outstanding IT experience to date, but am keen to get into the industry and gain some.</p>

<h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
<p> I had chosen to study at RMIT due to its notable programs in Information Technology (given by its name!) which has a good reputation across the country and even overseas. It’s a global university recognised for its leadership and innovation in technology and more. I also liked that RMIT gives students the relevant skills needed to enter a fulfilling career, opportunities to learn from experts and also make strong industry connections. Additionally a majority of my family and friends have studied/are studying at RMIT with me so that’s always a bonus. </p>

<h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
<p>From studying information technology at RMIT, i’m hoping to be provided with the skills to solve, support, troubleshoot and also design things from websites to programming networks. I’d like to undertake opportunities in work-itegrated learning activities enabling me to gain hands-on industry experience to create a professional network. I’m still a bit vague about what i want to specialise in but i hope throughout the program i’ll finally be able to decide on one that reflects the trends of emerging technologies and of course, i’ll enjoy.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<h4>Job Advertisement</h4>
<p><img src="dbaposition.jpg" alt="Job Advertisement for Database Administrator"></p>
<h4>Description of position</h4>
<p>Technology is used by database administrators (DBAs), who use specialised software to store and arrange data for businesses. Various pieces of information, such as private financial data, payroll information, or customer shipping records, may fall under this category. A DBA ensures that users can access data and that it is protected from theft, loss, or corruption due to accident.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Evaluation of database software purchases</li>
	<li>Overseeing the adaptation of any current database software to employer's needs</li>
    <li>Ensuring the performance and integrity of the company's databases</li>
    <li>Ensuring that data is stored safely and effectively.</li>
    <li>Updating database changes and instructing users on how to use systems</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why the position appeals to me</h4>
<p>This position appeals to me because based on my personal traits it seems I’d enjoy and work best in an administrative job. Admins in IT have a set variety of duties and tasks, and there lacks spontaneous changes in the role. Additionally this role incorporates security and IT together, both of which I am interested in. In terms of job outlook, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment possibilities for database administrators will increase by 10% between 2019 and 2029, outpacing the projected average growth for all occupations of 4%.
</p>
<h4>Skills, qualifications and experience required for this position</h4>
<p>Here's a list of database administrator skills that employers seek in candidates for employment. 
<ul>
	<li>Analytical skills: DBAs are required to keep an eye on the database's functioning and assess complex data from a range of sources.</li>
    <li>Communication skills: Since most DBAs work in teams, they must be able to communicate clearly with other team members, supervisors, and developers. </li>
    <li>Detail-oriented: When working with a database, an administrator must comprehend complex processes and how a small mistake can have a big impact. For instance, if a client's credit card information is misplaced, it may result in charges for items that the consumer did not make</li>
    <li>Problem-solving skills: Administrators must troubleshoot and fix issues as they arise.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A DBA must have a minimum of a four-year degree in a related field and relevant experience, as follows:

</ul>
</p>

<h4>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</h4>
<p>I currently lack the skills and experience necessary for the position. However, because I have experience working in the hospitality sector, I have developed my organisational, time management, and communication abilities, as well as the ability to work effectively in a team.</p>
<p>Over the next few years I will work towards completing my Bachelor of Information Technology. Finding an internship will be receive guidance by working with an experienced Database Administrator. I’ll prepare for interviews and brush up my resume to highlight relevant skills and previous experience, then search for job openings by visiting company websites directly, or attending industry events to meet potential hiring managers. </p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h4>Myer-Briggs Test</h4>
<p><img src="myerbriggs.jpg" alt="Myer-Briggs Test Result"><p>Consuls need to make a conscious effort to cultivate their less desirable characteristics and supplementary abilities, whether it is learning to unwind or managing their workload. The occupations that they find most fulfilling usually centre around making the best use of their traits of leading with practical sense and social devotion, as these are so powerfully exhibited. <p>Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making Consul personalities surprisingly good accountants. Purely analytical occupations may be too monotonous for consuls, so an excellent alternative would bring out their confidence in a position of authority while still being approachable and supportive enough to prevent it from appearing oppressive.<p>Regardless of their position, Consuls have definite habits in the workplace that come through. Clear hierarchies and duties are comfortable for consul personalities - they may even be dependent upon them - and consul personalities demand that those in positions of power be respected and supported by laws and norms.</p>
<h4>Learning Style Test</h4>
<p><img src="learningstyle.jpg" alt="Learning Style Test Result"><p>Reading or viewing images is how I learn best as a visual learner. I learn and retain information when employing approaches that are mostly visual since it helps to mentally envision what I am learning. I like to see what I am learning.
<p>Because of being a visual leaner, I tend to be orderly and tidy - these traits are beneficial for being organised and punctual in a team. I can have trouble following verbal instructions and be quickly distracted by noises, but on the other hand am drawn to colour and spoken language with vivid imagery, such as in storytelling, so the use of story boards in team meetings would be advantageous.</p>
<h4>Creativity Test</h4>
<p><img src="creativity.jpg" alt="Creativity Test Result"><p>Based on the above results from a creativity test, it’s a good idea for me to remember to take a break from issues in the creative process and give time to think about fresh solutions. This means there is time to incubate ideas rather than feeling under pressure to discover an immediate solution to an issue, while being proactive in problem-finding (which is one of my advantages).
<p>In a team it would benefit to create a thorough plan before putting ideas into action, employing action plans for straightforward initiatives and more formal project management procedures for bigger, trickier projects. If an idea has the potential to have an impact on others, I should encourage change management abilities so that those around me will value and utilise my creative output.<p>

When I complete the successful implementation of one idea, I’ll be inspired and motivated to carry out the process once more. This is a great trait to have in a team where projects are bound to be worked on, as it encourages passion and positivity in the work environment.

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>	This project would authenticate users at an ATM by using their fingerprints. The nature of each fingerprint being unique reinforces security measures when using ATMs, and this will be beneficial to consumers as well as the bigger financial institutions that own the ATMs.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Background</h4>
	<p>ATMs are convenient because they allow users to undertake quick self service operations such as deposits and cash withdrawals. They are becoming an important component of how clients transact money when many banks and financial institutions close their physical doors and reduce staff numbers to save money. <p>
	ATM security is critical for banks to preserve their quality of service and reputation. Specifically, this project will help in gaining users' trust and loyalty, reduce financial losses due to technological and non-technical robberies, and increased security will raise transaction rates, allowing banks to profit.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>Fingerprint Based ATM will be an application where the fingerprint of the user is used as  authentication. Fingerprints are different for each human being so the user can be identified uniquely. Due to this, users will no longer need to carry around a physical ATM card - with this, there is no worry of losing an ATM card nor the hassle of having to carry one around in the first place. Using their fingerprint to access ATM services will be safer and more secure. The user has to login using their fingerprint and possibly enter a password in order to continue with a transaction.
	<p>Features of the Fingerprint Based ATM would include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Login: User will login to the system using his fingerprint.</li>
		<li>Add Pin Code: User has to scan finger and add pin code in order to do transactions.</li>
		<li>Withdrawal of cash: User can withdraw cash by entering the amount they want to withdraw</li>
		<li>Transfer of Money: User can transfer cash to other accounts by entering the account number they want to transfer.</li>
		<li>View Balance: User can view balance which is available in the respective account.</li>
		<li>View Transaction: User can view last five transactions</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Technologies</h4>
	<p>Equipment the project would require include but are not limited to:
	<br>Software requirements:
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 7 and above.</li>
		<li>SQL server</li>
		<li>Visual studio</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*the above systems are used for software development and code writing for programs, and are able to be learned through a variety of courses.</p>

	<p>Hardware components: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Processor</li>
		<li>Hard Disk</li>
		<li>Memory</li>
		<li>Fingerprint Sensor</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Outcome</h4>
	<p>Given a successful project, financial losses will be prevented and the reputation of banks can be protected. Putting such a security measure in place (fingerprint based ATM) will protect the banking network and most importantly, customers’ personal information. <p>
		Working on this project will help obtain experience in the use of various computer systems and programming languages, specifically SQL, required for my ideal job.
